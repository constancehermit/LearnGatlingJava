Learn Gatling (with Java and Gradle)
=============================================

It's a Work In Progress :D

Pre-requisites
===

- JDK installed & $JAVA_HOME configured

I recommend installing OpenJDK 17.0 with [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/).   
It sets the PATH for you, and allows you to switch between JDK versions. (:
